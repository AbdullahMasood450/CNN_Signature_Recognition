## 🗂️ Project Overview

This project presents the development of a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to classify and identify handwritten signatures belonging to different individuals. The dataset consists of **16 images**, each containing **12 rows** with **4 signatures per row**.  

The goal is to segment these signatures, preprocess them, and train a CNN to recognize which signature belongs to which person. Labels follow the format **`imagenumber_rownumber`**, indicating the image and row the signature came from.  

The project also compares CNN-based feature extraction with manual techniques like **HOG** and **SIFT**, evaluating model performance using **precision**, **recall**, **F1 score**, **accuracy**, and training/testing loss curves.

## ⚙️ Data Loader Function

The data loader:
- Loads images and labels from a structured directory.
- Reads each signature in grayscale and resizes to 128×128 px.
- Labels each image as `imagenumber_rownumber`.
- Returns NumPy arrays for training/testing.
